    "My undergraduate degree was in Computer Information Systems with an emphasis in Business Intelligence at Cal Poly Pomona. The degree was basically what we are learning in MSBA, but we mainly used Python. Lots of Linear and Logistic Regression. However, halfway through my degree, when we really started to learn Business Intelligence, the COVID-19 pandemic started. Because of this I did not learn everything in the best setting and do not trust my knowledge. My parents pressured me into getting a Masters degree, and I found out that Cal Poly Pomona had the same 1 year MSBA program, but right before I applied I found out Cal Poly SLO also had the program and I always wanted to go here.
